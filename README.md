### Features

#### 1. Saves Precious Time

Does your team spend too much time screening candidates? Let it get back to doing what they do best - building the product - and let automation do the tedious work for you!

#### 2. Fast and relevant

Our platform lets you filter developers by basic technical skills that developers use everyday. This is way faster than a phone pre-screen, more relevant than a resume stuffed full of buzzwords. Wonder why organizations give so much importance to HR interviews? That's because an employee's personality is just as important for the job. We handle that as well, with an Interview Bot asking the candidates all the relevant questions and carrying out the analysis on behalf of the hiring company.

#### 3. Applicant approved

Technical candidates love our platform. Apply-by-AI is not just fast, it is way more fun than sending plain emails. We understand the tedious part of uploading a resume and managing one and help you offload it to your platform.
